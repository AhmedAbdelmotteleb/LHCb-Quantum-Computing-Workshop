# LHCb-Quantum-Computing-Workshop

- For day 1, you are expected to work on 10 questions in the notebook found in the directory `Day 1`. You are also encouraged to make use of the [IBM Quantum Composer](https://quantum.ibm.com/composer) (hopefully IBM doesn't cut support to that).

- For day 2, there are multiple exercises to do:
    - Deutsch-Jozsca
    - QAOA
    - Grover's algo
